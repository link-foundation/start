/**
 * Bounded-heap execution of the streaming log sanitizer (issue #2189).
 *
 * {@link sanitizeLogFileToFile} is already memory-bounded by construction: it
 * holds one block at a time and caps its hold-back. This module is the second
 * line of defence issue #2189 asks for —
 *
 * > A worker with a bounded heap for the sanitize step would also contain any
 * > residual blow-up instead of taking the whole run down.
 *
 * Node's `worker_threads` gives each worker its own V8 isolate with its own
 * `resourceLimits`. Exceeding them terminates the worker with
 * `ERR_WORKER_OUT_OF_MEMORY` and leaves the parent running, verified in
 * `experiments/issue-2189-bounded-sanitize-worker.mjs`. So even if a future
 * pattern, a pathological log, or a dependency upgrade reintroduces an
 * unbounded allocation inside the sanitizer, the blast radius is one thread and
 * one failed log upload — not the working session that already did its job.
 *
 * The worker is only worth its start-up cost on logs big enough to matter, so
 * small logs run in-process ({@link DEFAULT_WORKER_THRESHOLD_BYTES}). If the
 * worker cannot even start (no `worker_threads`, a module resolution failure,
 * a restricted runtime) the sanitize falls back in-process, which is exactly
 * the behaviour before this module existed. Once the worker has reported
 * `ready`, failures are propagated instead: falling back in-process after the
 * worker hit its heap limit would run the same blow-up in the parent.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/link-assistant/hive-mind/issues/2189
