But if it is not possible we should make sure at start and end blocks we do display that info, so if for example we use detached mode, or attached mode without closing of screen/docker container we should be able to see all the data to reconnect to them.\n\nPlease download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to `./docs/case-studies/issue-{id}` folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/link-foundation/start/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/link-foundation/start/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
