feat: Replace fixed-width box output with status spine format

- Replaced box-style output format with spine format using `|`, `$`, `✓`, and `✗` symbols
- Removed all legacy BoxStyle, get_box_style(), and box-drawing functions
- Added new spine format functions: create_spine_line, create_empty_spine_line, create_command_line
- Added get_result_marker function returning success/failure symbols
- Added IsolationMetadata struct and parsing for isolation environment info
- Updated create_start_block and create_finish_block to use spine format
- Format is width-independent, lossless, and portable across all terminal environments
