feat: Add signal handling and cleanup for stale execution records

- Added signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP to properly update
  execution status when a command is interrupted
- Added --cleanup and --cleanup-dry-run CLI options to clean up stale
  "executing" records (processes that crashed or were killed)
- Stale detection based on: process no longer running, or age > 24 hours
- Exit codes follow convention: 128 + signal number (e.g., 130 for SIGINT)
- Cleaned records marked as "executed" with exit code -1

Fixes #60
