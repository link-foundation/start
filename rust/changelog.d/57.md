fix: Use piped stdout/stderr with threads for reliable real-time output capture

- Changed from `Stdio::inherit()` with `.output()` to `Stdio::piped()` with `.spawn()`
- Added threads to read stdout/stderr in real-time while also capturing for the log file
- Ensures both immediate output display and proper log file capture on macOS
- Fixes Issue #57: Commands like `echo hi` now show output and finish block reliably
