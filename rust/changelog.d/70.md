feat: Rename spine to timeline, add virtual command visualization for Docker

- Renamed "spine" terminology to "timeline" throughout the codebase
  - `SPINE` constant → `TIMELINE_MARKER` (old name deprecated)
  - `create_spine_line()` → `create_timeline_line()` (old name deprecated)
  - `create_empty_spine_line()` → `create_empty_timeline_line()` (old name deprecated)
- Added virtual command visualization for Docker image pulls
  - When Docker isolation requires pulling an image, it's shown as `$ docker pull <image>`
  - Pull output is streamed in real-time with result markers (✓/✗)
  - Only displayed when image actually needs to be pulled (conditional display)
- New API additions:
  - `create_virtual_command_block()` - for formatting virtual commands
  - `create_virtual_command_result()` - for result markers
  - `docker_image_exists()` - check if image is available locally
  - `docker_pull_image()` - pull with streaming output
  - `StartBlockOptions.defer_command` - defer command display for multi-step execution
- All deprecated items have backward-compatible aliases for smooth migration

Fixes #70
