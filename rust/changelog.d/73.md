fix: Fix visual continuity in docker isolation mode

- Fixed empty line placement in docker isolation output
- Empty line is now correctly placed AFTER the command (`$ docker pull alpine:latest`)
  instead of BEFORE it
- Maintains consistent visual structure in timeline output
- Added tests for visual continuity behavior

Before:
```
│

$ docker pull alpine:latest
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
```

After:
```
│
$ docker pull alpine:latest

latest: Pulling from library/alpine
```

Fixes #73
