fix: Remove empty line after virtual command to maintain visual continuity

- Fixed visual continuity break in docker pull output
- Removed empty line between timeline marker (`│`) and virtual command line (`$ docker pull`)
- Output now flows continuously from timeline marker to command to output
- Applies to all virtual command blocks (currently docker pull operations)

Fixes #73
